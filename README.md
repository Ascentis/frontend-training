# js_fundamental

JS code snippets with explanation to cover JS fundamentals.

## Prerequisite

These code snippets assume basic understanding and coding experience with JavaScript and general programming, and focus on weird/confusing/new part of JS language. But no need to worry, as far as you have basic JS programming background, it won't be hard to follow. Because each example has concise and clear explanations.

## Content

There are two folders: es5 and es6. es5 folder focus on es5 (traditional) js features, es6 illustrate some ES6 new features. Also there's .eslintrc and .prettierrc file which help to format the code, and see issues through linter (would be useful if you want to try write some of your own examples in this project)
